# Academic CV

This repo contains my academic CV in latex, available as a [PDF](cv-rivers.pdf). It generally conforms to Karen Kelsky's guidelines, with some tweaks for clearer information presentation and nicer typography.

The template was modified from these two MIT-licensed sources:

* [Template](https://github.com/gboeing/cv)
* [Modifications for a Bibtex based listing of papers](https://github.com/rgeirhos/academic-cv-publications/blob/master/cv/cv.tex)
