	abstract = {Oral immunotherapy (OIT) with peanut (Arachis hypogaea) allergen powder-dnfp (PTAH; Aimmune Therapeutics) is an FDA-approved treatment to desensitize peanut allergic participants. Here we assessed shifts in IgE and IgG4 binding to peanut allergens and their epitopes recognized by United States (US) peanut allergic participants (n = 20) enrolled in phase 3 PTAH OIT clinical trials. Preand post-trial participant sera were collected approximately 12 months apart and tested for IgE binding to intact peanut proteins via ImmunoCAP ISAC immunoassays. IgE and IgG4 linear epitopes were identified based on binding to synthetic overlapping 15-mer linear peptides of 10 peanut allergens (Ara h 1-11) synthesized on microarray slides. Statistically significant decreases in IgE binding were identified for intact Ara h 2, 3, and 6, and known and newly identified IgE epitopes were shown to exhibit shifts towards IgG4 binding post-OIT, with most linear peptides having increased IgG4 binding after treatment with PTAH. While PTAH does not seem to alter the actual peptide binding patterns significantly after one year of treatment, the IgE and IgG4 binding ratios and intensity are altered. At a population level, the linear IgE and IgG4 epitopes of 10 peanut allergens overlap and that increase in IgG4 with OIT results in displacement of IgE binding to both conformational and linear epitopes. Furthermore, it appears as though the increase in IgG4 is more important to achieve desensitization at the 12-month timepoint than the decrease in IgE. This type of knowledge can be useful in the identification of IgE and IgG4-binding allergen and peptide biomarkers that may indicate desensitization or sustained unresponsiveness of allergic individuals to peanut.Graphical abstract.

abstract = {Background CRISPR-Cas systems have expanded the possibilities for gene editing in bacteria and eukaryotes. There are many excellent tools for designing the CRISPR-Cas guide RNAs for model organisms with standard Cas enzymes. GuideMaker is intended as a fast and easy-to-use design tool for atypical projects with 1) non-standard Cas enzymes, 2) non-model organisms, or 3) projects that need to design a panel of guide RNAs (gRNA) for genome-wide screens.
Findings GuideMaker can rapidly design gRNAs for gene targets across the genome from a degenerate protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) and a GenBank file. The tool applies Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs to speed up the comparison of guide RNAs. This allows the user to design gRNAs targeting all genes in a typical bacterial genome in about 1-2 minutes.
Conclusions Guidemaker enables the rapid design of genome-wide gRNA for any CRISPR-Cas enzyme in non-model organisms. While GuideMaker is designed with prokaryotic genomes in mind, it can efficiently process smaller eukaryotic genomes as well. GuideMaker is available as command-line software, a stand-alone web application, and a tool in the CyCverse Discovery Environment.

abstract = {Adenine and thymine homopolymer strings of at least 8 nucleotides (AT 8+mers) were characterized in \emph{Salmonella enterica} subspecies I and other Eubacteria. Incidence of the motif differed between Eubacteria but not between Salmonella enterica serotypes. Of 481 AT 8+mers loci in serovars Typhimurium, Enteritidis, and Gallinarum, 35 (12.3\%) had mutations. We propose that the AT 8+mer motif identifies genomes with optimal gene content and provides self-recognition that facilitates efficient genome repair. A theory that genome regeneration accounts for both serovar diversity and persistence of predominant Salmonella serovars associated provides a new framework for investigating root causes of foodborne illness.},

The rice rhizo-sphere microbial community composition of nine recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and their parents, Francis and Rondo, segregating for root and shoot biomass, was determined using metagenomic sequencing as a means to examine how biomass phenotype influences the rhizosphere community. Two plant developmental stages were studied, heading and physiological maturity, based on root and shoot biomass growth patterns across the selected genotypes. We used partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis to examine plant trait?driven microbial populations and identify microbial species, functions, and genes corresponding to root and shoot biomass as well as developmental stage patterns. Species identified correlated with increases in either root or shoot biomass were widely present in soil and included species involved in nitrogen cycling (Anaeromyxobacter spp.) and methane production (Methanocella avoryzae), as well as known endophytes (Bradyrhizobium spp.). Additionally, PLS analysis allowed us to explore the relationship of developmental stage with species, microbial functions, and genes. Many of the community functions and genes observed during the heading stage were representative of cell growth (e.g., carbohydrate and nitrogen metabo-lism), while functions correlated with physiological maturity were indicative of cell decay. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that microbial communities exist whose metabolic and gene functions correspond to plant biomass traits.},

	abstract     = {Rice production is an important source of methane accounting for 11\% of global anthropogenic emissions. Methane emissions can be effectively reduced by management practices and cultivar selection. However, whether cultivars lower methane emissions primarily through mediating whole microbial community shifts or through more targeted interactions with methane-cycling microbes is not understood. Here, we sequenced the soil metagenomes associated with two rice recombinant inbred lines (RILs) along with their parents, Francis and Rondo, displaying a range of low to high methane emitting phenotypes. Methane emissions and rhizosphere soil microbial communities were sampled at booting, heading, grain fill, and maturity growth stages to evaluate how plant development impacted rhizosphere communities. Methane emissions were low at booting and increased during heading and grain fill stages where peak methane emissions were observed and returned to basal levels at maturity. In response to genotype and plant developmental stage, we observed changes in rhizosphere microbial community structure in several methanogenic archaea as well as bacterial methane oxidizers and sulfur cyclers. Rice genotype played a larger role in influencing the soil microbial community structure during the reproductive phases of booting and heading as compared to the ripening phases (grain fill and maturity). Francis showed lower methane emissions and relative abundance of methanogen populations during the heading stage where methane emissions were highest for the other genotypes. This indicated that the reduced methane emissions trait was associated with small changes in the composition of methanogens rather than wholesale community shifts. This finding suggests future breeding efforts can focus on reducing methane emissions during high methane emitting phases (i.e., reproductive phases) by selecting genotypes that have lower methanogen populations and higher methanotroph populations during these developmental stages.},

Approximately half of the viral contigs are grouped into genetically distinct quasi-species clusters. Microbial hosts are predicted for 20 000 viral sequences, revealing nine microbial phyla previously unreported to be infected by viruses. Viral sequences can be queried using a variety of associated metadata, including habitat type and geographic location of the samples, or taxonomic classification according to hallmark viral genes. IMG/VR has a user-friendly interface that allows users to interrogate all integrated data and interact by comparingwith external sequences, thus serving as an essential resource in the viral genomics community.},

We used amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR to (i) examine how fungi are influenced by depth in the peat profile, water table and plant functional group at the onset of a multiyear mesocosm experiment, and (ii) test if fungi are correlated with abiotic variables of peat and pore water. We hypothesized that each factor influenced fungi, but that depth would have the strongest effect early in the experiment. We found that (i) communities were strongly depth stratified; fungi were four times more abundant in the upper (10-20 cm) than the lower (30-40 cm) depth, and dominance shifted from ericoid mycorrhizal fungi to saprotrophs and endophytes with increasing depth; (ii) the influence of plant functional group was depth dependent, with Ericaceae structuring the community in the upper peat only; (iii) water table had minor influences; and (iv) communities strongly covaried with abiotic variables, including indices of peat and pore water carbon quality. Our results highlight the importance of vertical stratification to peatland fungi, and the depth dependency of plant functional group effects, which must be considered when elucidating the role of fungi in peatland carbon dynamics.},

	abstract     = {Human impacts on aquatic biodiversity are often measured at the assemblage or community level, although it has been suggested that individual-level measures are more sensitive. We evaluated the effects of anthropogenic sedimentation on endemics snails in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, by comparing assemblage-level (i.e., species richness, evennes, and abundance) and individual-level (i.e., frequencies of predation and parasitism, fecal organic content, life history) data between sediment-disturbed and reference sites. Previous studies have indicated that sedimentation kills snails and reduce mollusc diversity in this system, but we found little evidence of changes in species richness, evenness, or snail abundance at the levels of sedimentation recorded. In contrast, individual-level data revealed a variety of differences associated with sedimentation. Frequencies of shell scarring by predatory crabs and castration by parasitic trematodes were significantly lower at disturbed sites, indicating shifts in interspecific interactions. Snails ingested large amounts of inorganic sediments at disturbed sites, suggesting a reduction in food quality. In addition, sedimentation was associated with a large downward shift in size distribution within some species and reproduction at smaller size. These strong patterns in individual-level data contrast with the lack of effects at the assemblage level. We argue that incorporating individual-level measures will often enhance the sensitivity of impact surveys and may reveal effects of disturbance on important interspecific interactions.},

To understand their capacity to respond to Fe stress, we screened picoplankton genomes and the Global Ocean Survey metagenome for known Fe stress genes. Many open ocean strains of Synechococcus lack most known genes for Fe stress, while coastal and upwelling strains contain many, suggesting that maintaining multiple Fe limitation compensation strategies is not a selective advantage in the open ocean. All genomes contained iron deficiency-induced protein A (IdiA) and its complementary Fe3+ transport proteins. The ubiquity of IdiA was exploited to develop an in situ Fe stress bioassay based on immunolabelling and flow cytometry. As a test of field applicability, we used the assay on natural Synechococcus populations from one station in the Costa Rica Upwelling Dome where total Fe ranged from {\textless}0.08 to 0.14†nM in the upper water column. The bioassay found Fe stress in 5201354{\%} of the population. Based on our findings, we believe that when reactive strains are present this assay can reveal environmental and clade-specific differences in the response of Synechococcus to Fe stress.},

	abstract     = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region between the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene and large subunit ribosomal RNA gene is a widely used phylogenetic marker for fungi and other taxa. The eukaryotic ITS contains the conserved 5.8S rRNA and is divided into the ITS1 and ITS2 hypervariable regions. These regions are variable in length and are amplified using primers complementary to the conserved regions of their flanking genes. Previous work has shown that removing the conserved regions results in more accurate taxonomic classification. An existing software program, ITSx, is capable of trimming FASTA sequences by matching hidden Markov model profiles to the ends of the conserved genes using the software suite HMMER. ITSxpress was developed to extend this technique from marker gene studies using Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU's) to studies using exact sequence variants; a method used by the software packages Dada2, Deblur, QIIME 2, and Unoise. The sequence variant approach uses the quality scores of each read to identify sequences that are statistically likely to represent real sequences. ITSxpress enables this by processing FASTQ rather than FASTA files. The software also speeds up the trimming of reads by a factor of 14-23 times on a 4-core computer by temporarily clustering highly similar sequences that are common in amplicon data and utilizing optimized parameters for Hmmsearch. ITSxpress is available as a QIIME 2 plugin and a stand-alone application installable from the Python package index, Bioconda, and Github.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

In the first experiment comparing seawater and seawater amended with diatom-derived DOM, metatranscriptomes revealed pronounced differences in pathways involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. In the second experiment comparing seawater amended with cyanobacteria- and diatom-derived DOM, metatranscriptomes had similar functional profiles, likely reflecting more similar DOM regimes in this experimental setup. Among the five most abundant taxa investigated in more detail, two featured pronounced differences in transcript abundance between treatments suggesting that they were specialized in the use of only one of the two DOM regimes. However, these two taxa were less involved in carbohydrate metabolism than others and had few genes that were significantly regulated in response to the DOM source. Our results indicate that both substrate composition and the competitive interplay of community members were decisive for the functional response of a microbial system.},

RNAseq analysis identified 99 putative sRNAs. Sixty-nine were cis-encoded and located antisense to a presumed target gene. Thirty were trans-encoded and initial target prediction was performed computationally. The most prevalent functional roles of genes anti-sense to the cis-sRNAs were transport, cell-cell interactions, signal transduction, and transcriptional regulation. Most sRNAs were transcribed equally under both C and N limitation, and may be involved in a general stress response. However, 14 were regulated differentially between the C and N treatments and may respond to specific nutrient limitations. A network analysis of the predicted target genes of the R. pomeroyi cis-sRNAs indicated that they average fewer connections than typical protein-encoding genes, and appear to be more important in peripheral or niche-defining functions encoded in the pan genome.},

We sequenced 16S rRNA amplicons to examine the structure of the SML microbiome within and between colonies of the threatened Caribbean reef-building coral Acropora palmata in the Florida Keys. Samples were taken from three spatially distinct colony regions-uppermost (high irradiance), underside (low irradiance), and the colony base-representing microhabitats that vary in irradiance and water flow. Phylogenetic diversity (PD) values of coral SML bacteria communities were greater than surrounding seawater and lower than adjacent sediment. Bacterial diversity and community composition was consistent among the three microhabitats. Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, and Proteobacteria, respectively were the most abundant phyla represented in the samples. This is the first time spatial variability of the surface mucus layer of A. palmata has been studied. Homogeneity in the microbiome of A. palmata contrasts with SML heterogeneity found in other Caribbean corals. These findings suggest that, during non-stressful conditions, host regulation of SML microbiota may override diverse physiochemical influences induced by the topographical complexity of A. palmata. Documenting the spatial distribution of SML microbes is essential to understanding the functional roles these microorganisms play in coral health and adaptability to environmental perturbations.},

Methodological limitations have restricted the quantification of PP to the measurement of a few traits in single organisms. We used metatranscriptomic libraries to overcome these challenges and estimate PP using the expressed genes of multiple heterotrophic organisms as a proxy for traits in a microbial community. The metatranscriptomes captured the expression response of natural marine bacterial communities grown on differing carbon resource regimes in continuous cultures. We found that taxa with different magnitudes of PP coexisted in the same cultures, and that members of the order Rhodobacterales had the highest levels of PP. In agreement with previous studies, our results suggest that continuous culturing may have specifically selected for taxa featuring a rather high range of PP. On average, PP and abundance changes within a taxon contributed equally to the organism's change in functional gene abundance, implying that both PP and abundance mediated observed differences in community function. However, not all functional changes due to PP were directly reflected in the bulk community functional response: gene expression changes in individual taxa due to PP were partly masked by counterbalanced expression of the same gene in other taxa. This observation demonstrates that PP had a stabilizing effect on a community's functional response to environmental change.},

	abstract     = {The Deepwater Horizon blowout released a massive amount of oil and gas into the deep ocean between April and July 2010, stimulating microbial blooms of petroleum-degrading bacteria. To understand the metabolic response of marine microorganisms, we sequenced ∼66 million community transcripts that revealed the identity of metabolically active microbes and their roles in petroleum consumption. Reads were assigned to reference genes from ∼2700 bacterial and archaeal taxa, but most assignments (39{\%}) were to just six genomes representing predominantly methane- and petroleum-degrading Gammaproteobacteria. Specific pathways for the degradation of alkanes, aromatic compounds and methane emerged from the metatranscriptomes, with some transcripts assigned to methane monooxygenases representing highly divergent homologs that may degrade either methane or short alkanes. The microbial community in the plume was less taxonomically and functionally diverse than the unexposed community below the plume; this was due primarily to decreased species evenness resulting from Gammaproteobacteria blooms. Surprisingly, a number of taxa (related to SAR11, Nitrosopumilus and Bacteroides, among others) contributed equal numbers of transcripts per liter in both the unexposed and plume samples, suggesting that some groups were unaffected by the petroleum inputs and blooms of degrader taxa, and may be important for re-establishing the pre-spill microbial community structure.The ISME Journal advance online publication, 1 August 2013; doi:10.1038/ismej.2013.129.},

	abstract     = {The incidence of locally acquired dengue infections increased during the last decade in the United States, compelling a sustained research effort concerning the dengue mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti , and its microbiome, which has been shown to influence virus transmission success. We examined the ?metavirome? of four populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes collected in 2016 to 2017 in Manatee County, FL. Unexpectedly, we discovered that dengue virus serotype 4 (DENV4) was circulating in these mosquito populations, representing the first documented case of such a phenomenon in the absence of a local DENV4 human case in this county over a 2-year period. We confirmed that all of the mosquito populations carried the same DENV4 strain, assembled its full genome, validated infection orthogonally by reverse transcriptase PCR, traced the virus origin, estimated the time period of its introduction to the Caribbean region, and explored the viral genetic signatures and mosquito-specific virome associations that potentially mediated DENV4 persistence in mosquitoes. We discuss the significance of prolonged maintenance of the DENV4 infections in A. aegypti that occurred in the absence of a DENV4 human index case in Manatee County with respect to the inability of current surveillance paradigms to detect mosquito vector infections prior to a potential local outbreak.},
